## Changed in v2024.5

* Vignette scanning: option to alert on zone-wide vignettes. I originally disabled these because it can be really spammy in zones like Timeless Isles / Zereth Mortis. Turn it off in the options at `Scanning > Vignettes`
* Add the I'm In Your Base, Killing Your Dudes achievement in Krasarang
* Remove a long-removed-from-the-game old trinket from Kal'tik the Blight
