[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags/compare/v0.1.46...v0.1.47) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags/releases)

- Fixed a bug where sorting would cause items not to be marked as new.  
- Fixed a bug where bag opacity was ignored in non-retail builds.  
- All new items coming into bags now go to recent items and glow (including bank, containers, etc).  
    Bag view is now always sorted correctly.
